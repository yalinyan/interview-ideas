Great question! **OAuth 2.0** and **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** are both modern standards used for **secure authorization and authentication** in web and mobile applications. They’re often used together but serve different purposes.

---

## 🔑 **OAuth 2.0 – Authorization Framework**

### 📌 **Purpose**:

OAuth 2.0 is a **delegation protocol** that allows a user to grant **limited access** to their resources to a third-party application **without sharing their credentials**.

### 🧠 Think of it as:

> *"I allow this app to act on my behalf, but I don't give it my password."*

### 🔄 How it Works (Simplified Flow):

1. **User** tries to log into a third-party app using their Google account.
2. The app redirects the user to Google’s **authorization server**.
3. The user **logs into Google** and grants permission.
4. Google sends an **authorization code** back to the app.
5. The app exchanges this code for an **access token**.
6. The app uses this **access token** to access the user’s data (like calendar or email) on Google’s API.

### 🔐 Tokens:

* **Access Token**: Used by the app to access resources (expires quickly).
* **Refresh Token** (optional): Used to get a new access token without re-authenticating.

### ✅ Use cases:

* Letting a 3rd-party app access your Google Drive files.
* Mobile apps accessing APIs on behalf of users.

## 👤 **OpenID Connect (OIDC) – Authentication Layer**

### 📌 **Purpose**:

OpenID Connect is an **authentication layer** built **on top of OAuth 2.0**. It **verifies the user's identity** and provides information (ID) about the user.

### 🧠 Think of it as:

> *"Who is this user?" (authentication) instead of just "Can this app access their data?" (authorization).*

### 🧾 It adds:

* An **ID Token** (a JWT) containing:

  * User’s identity info (email, name, etc.)
  * Auth time, expiration, etc.
* A **/userinfo** endpoint for fetching user profile data.

### 🔄 Typical OpenID Flow:

1. App redirects user to Identity Provider (e.g., Google).
2. User authenticates.
3. Identity Provider returns an **ID token** (JWT) + **access token**.
4. App verifies the ID token to authenticate the user.

### ✅ Use cases:

* Single Sign-On (SSO).
* Login with Google, Facebook, Apple.
* Identity federation.

## 🔐 Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're at a hotel:

* **OAuth 2.0**: You get a **keycard** that opens the gym and pool (limited access), but you didn't give them your house keys.
* **OpenID Connect**: You also show your **passport** (identity proof) when checking in.

### 🔐 What is a JWT Token?

**JWT** stands for **JSON Web Token**. It's a **compact**, **URL-safe** token format used to **securely transmit information** between parties—typically used for **authentication** and **authorization**.

## 🧱 Structure of a JWT

A JWT is a single string with three parts, separated by dots (`.`):

```
xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
  │      │      │
  │      │      └─ Signature
  │      └──────── Payload (claims)
  └──────────────── Header
```

### 1. **Header**

* Specifies metadata and algorithm used.

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

### 2. **Payload (Claims)**

* Contains **user info** and other **claims** (data).

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "Alice",
  "admin": true,
  "iat": 1716641234,
  "exp": 1716644834
}
```

> ❗️Claims like `exp` (expiration), `sub` (subject), and `iss` (issuer) help with validation.

### 3. **Signature**

* Used to verify the token's integrity (not tampered with).
* Created like this:

```
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret
)
```

## ✅ Why Use JWTs?

| Feature          | Description                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔐 **Secure**    | Signed to prevent tampering (optionally encrypted). |
| 🌐 **Portable**  | Works across domains and systems.                   |
| 📦 **Compact**   | Easy to pass in HTTP headers or URLs.               |
| 🕓 **Stateless** | No need for server-side session storage.            |

---

## 🔄 Common Use Cases

### ✅ **Authentication (AuthN)**

* After login, the server issues a JWT.
* The client stores it (e.g. in `localStorage`) and sends it with every request.
* The server verifies the JWT to authenticate the user.

### ✅ **Authorization (AuthZ)**

* JWT contains user roles/permissions.
* Backend checks these to allow or deny access to resources.

### ✅ **API Security**

* Passed as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
* Validated by API gateway or service.

## ⚠️ JWT Pitfalls to Watch For

| Risk                              | Mitigation                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔓 **Unexpired Tokens**           | Always set short `exp` time + use refresh tokens.     |
| 🛠️ **No Signature Verification** | Never trust a token without validating the signature. |
| 📤 **Stored in localStorage**     | Prefer `HttpOnly` cookies if worried about XSS.       |
| 🔁 **No Revocation**              | Implement token blacklists or rotation strategies.    |

## 🧠 Summary

| Term      | What it Means                                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| JWT       | A signed token that holds data and proves identity. |
| Header    | Metadata about the token.                           |
| Payload   | The actual claims or data.                          |
| Signature | Ensures the token wasn't tampered with.             |
