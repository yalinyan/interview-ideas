1. Design a URL Shortening Service (e.g., Bit.ly)
Approach:

Architecture: Use a microservices approach with components like an API gateway, encoding service, and database.

Database: Implement a NoSQL database (e.g., DynamoDB) for scalability.

Collision Handling: Use hash functions with collision detection mechanisms.

Scalability: Incorporate caching (e.g., Redis) and load balancers.

Security: Implement rate limiting and authentication.

2. How Would You Design a File-Sharing Service Like Dropbox?
Approach:

Storage: Use cloud storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3) with redundancy.

Synchronization: Implement file versioning and conflict resolution.

Security: Ensure end-to-end encryption and access controls.

Performance: Use content delivery networks (CDNs) for faster access.

This evaluates your understanding of distributed systems and data consistency.

3. How Would You Design a Scalable Music Streaming Service?
Approach:

Architecture: Use a microservices architecture separating user management, content delivery, and analytics.

Streaming: Implement adaptive bitrate streaming for varying network conditions.

Data Storage: Use distributed databases for user data and metadata.

Scalability: Employ auto-scaling groups and load balancers.

This question tests your ability to handle high-traffic, real-time systems.



Q: Design a scalable checkout system for Apple’s online store.
A:

Microservices: Split cart, inventory, payment.

Idempotency keys: Prevent duplicate charges.

Fallbacks: Cache product prices during outages.
Apple’s scale: Prioritize latency (e.g., edge computing) 37.

Q: How would you architect a real-time collaboration tool (like Apple Notes web)?
A:

Operational Transform (OT): Resolve edit conflicts.

WebSockets: For live updates (Apple uses CloudKit for sync).

Conflict resolution: Last-write-wins with user prompts 610.
